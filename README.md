# Work-Day-Planner

In this codebase you will find a planner that functions as a tool to save data for the user depending on what they want to get done for the particular day.

# Functionality

MomentJS was utilized to display the current day upon page load / refresh and Moment was also used with a conditional statement to color code the timeblocks depending on the time of the day (grey=past, red=current, green=future). The user can click into each specific time block which functions as a 'textarea' to type whatever they want. The blue buttons associated with each timeblock are save buttons, and upon clicking them, whatever the user types in the colored time blocks will be saved to local storage so that upon page load/refresh, the data in the text boxes will persist.
